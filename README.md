# Brain-Stroke-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning-for-Clinical-Decision-Support-Systems

* Collected comprehensive medical data comprising nearly 50,000 patient records.
* Conducted in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to discern the demographic distribution based on age, gender, and pre-existing health conditions.
* Mitigated the issue of an imbalanced dataset by employing Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to generate synthetic data.
* Identified and extracted pertinent features highly correlated with stroke occurrences.
* Implemented a suite of advanced Machine Learning algorithms including linear regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to detect strokes.
* Achieved a remarkable accuracy rate of nearly 92% following model training.
